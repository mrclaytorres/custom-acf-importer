# custom-acf-importer

This Wordpress plugin was derived from this post tutorial: [Importing Data From a CSV File Into a Wordpress ACF Repeater Field](https://medium.com/@alexjeffers/importing-data-from-a-csv-file-into-a-wordpress-acf-repeater-field-c411c642a54c)  

For our use-case, I simply made some modifications to suit my needs.

The plugin will bulk import data to a repeater-type field.

For this example, I wanted to bulk import some FAQ data (Question and its answer) into my Wordpress posts.
